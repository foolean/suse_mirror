# suse_mirror

SuSE package repository mirroring tool

SuSE provides their own mirroring tool however, it relies on being run from a
SuSE/SLES system.  There are cases where a site must support multiple
operating systems and thus the mirror system may not be a SuSE/SLES system.
This script is a relatively simple python script that can mirror the SuSE
packages repositories from any system.
